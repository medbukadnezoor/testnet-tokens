How to Deploy Testnet Tokens in EVM Testnets Tutorial

Introduction

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of deploying your own testnet tokens on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) testnets. As a developer, deploying tokens in a testnet environment is a critical skill to hone. You get to test your tokens and smart contracts without any real-world financial implications. Moreover, doing so allows you to participate in token airdrops, which are distribution of tokens to network participants, often for free. These airdrops can serve as a promotional activity, sparking interest and encouraging wider use of your token.

But why does this matter? Well, in the bubbling cauldron of blockchain development, airdrops are the secret spices that can give your project the flavor it needs to stand out. The testnet environment allows you to experiment with these ingredients, tweaking and perfecting your recipe before presenting it to the world.

Tutorial Steps
Open Chrome and navigate to the Ethereum IDE, Remix, at remix.ethereum.org.

Accept the terms and conditions, then click 'Next' followed by 'Done'.

In the left panel, click the small icon to create a new file. Name this new file 'ERC20.sol'.

Now, it's time to add some code. Copy and paste the provided ERC20 Solidity code into your newly created 'ERC20.sol' file.

Once the code is in place, click the red "1" button in the left panel to access the Solidity compiler. Then click "2" to compile the file.

Now, switch your MetaMask network to the appropriate testnet (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, etc.). Click "red 1", choose 'Injected Web3' as the environment, which should connect to MetaMask. In the 'Deploy' field, type your desired token name and symbol. For example, you could use 'Token' for the name and 'TKN' for the symbol. Click 'Transact' to deploy the contract.

Once the contract is deployed, you can mint new tokens. In the 'mint' field, input the number of tokens you want to create (e.g., 18000000000000000000000000). Click 'Transact' to mint your tokens.

Copy the address of the deployed contract (it will be in the red circle).

Now, head over to Uniswap or any other decentralized exchange (DEX) to create a new pool with your tokens.

And voila! You have successfully deployed your own tokens on a testnet. Others can now purchase your tokens via Uniswap or your chosen DEX.

Remember, this is just the beginning. The world of blockchain development is rich with possibilities. Deploying testnet tokens and participating in airdrops are just the first steps in your journey. Happy coding!
